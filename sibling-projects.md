# Sibling projects

The Context-Generic Programming ecosystem is split across several repositories that are developed
together, and this file records where each one lives and which revision of it to read. An agent
working here routinely needs one of them — to verify a claim against another project's source, to
revise a document a change here affects, or to keep a fixture and the prose that describes it in
step — so treat this table as the authoritative list of what exists alongside this repository.

The skills here are built from the knowledge base, which is the source of truth they distill: a
change to a CGP construct lands there first, and the matching sub-skill is revised in the same
change.

| Project | Repository | Branch/tag to read | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cgp` | <https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp> | `main` | The CGP library: the proc-macro suite and the runtime crates its expansions target. |
| `cargo-cgp` | <https://github.com/contextgeneric/cargo-cgp> | `main` | CGP's first-class toolchain: the cargo subcommand that makes CGP compile errors readable and expands CGP macros. |
| `cgp-knowledge-base` | <https://github.com/contextgeneric/cgp-knowledge-base> | `main` | The consolidated documentation for every CGP project, written by and for AI agents. |

## Finding a sibling

Look for a sibling in the parent directory first, at `../<project>`. Every project in this list,
including this one, is expected to sit side by side under one parent directory in a local
environment, so `../cgp` is the fastest and most current reference — it reflects uncommitted work
that GitHub does not. When the checkout is absent, fetch the file you need from the repository above
instead, at the revision the table records.

## Reading a sibling versus linking to one

Reading and linking follow different rules, and conflating them is the mistake to avoid. When you
**read** a document or a source file from a sibling, use the branch or tag this table names, so every
project sees the same revision of the others. When you **link** to one from a committed file here, always
write a GitHub URL on the `main` branch (`https://github.com/contextgeneric/<project>/blob/main/<path>`)
rather than a relative `../<project>/...` path, so the link resolves for a reader who has only this
repository checked out. A bare mention of a checkout's location, like the path `../cgp`, is a
filesystem reference rather than a link and stays relative.

## Updating a revision

The branch or tag recorded above changes **only on explicit instruction**, such as when a project
cuts an official release and the ecosystem should pin it. During ordinary development every entry
stays `main`, and it deliberately does *not* track a feature branch in progress: work in flight is
read from the local sibling checkout, not from a revision recorded here. The same rule governs the
`main` in a cross-project link — update it only when told to, as part of a release.
